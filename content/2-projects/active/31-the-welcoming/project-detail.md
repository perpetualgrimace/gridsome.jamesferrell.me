import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

Roughly two years after my band’s first album release, with a handful of shows and another release under our belt, I felt like we finally had enough content to warrant making a website.

The website provides visitors with links to all of our socials and streaming platforms wherever appropriate and automatically pulls in upcoming events from Bandsintown. I peppered in lots of pictures of us (hopefully) looking cool, and injected personality into the copy where possible.

There’s a press kit page, with media stats, reviews, interviews, and a bunch of assets for anyone who might need them. We also include quotes from people all throughout the site. The main goal is to appear more legitimate than we are, helping us make a good impression with bigger venues and bands.

_We are pretty legit, though._

The site was built in NextJS, with an audio player that can keep playing as the user navigates throughout the site.

<CTA heading="Want a band or artist website like this one?" text="I’m currently offering a struggling musician special!" linkText="Get started" />
