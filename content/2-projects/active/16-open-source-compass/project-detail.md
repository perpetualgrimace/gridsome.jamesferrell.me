import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

This was my favorite project at Datawheel. We partnered with [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/) to deliever a really nice resource for exploring the state of programming languages and libraries via [Github](https://github.com/) data.

It was the first project where I was able to lead the development team, and we spent a lot of time getting all the UX details perfectly dialed in.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the site relying heavily on APIs, even the [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227162442/https://opensourcecompass.io/) of the site no longer works. You can see it, but you can’t see or interact with any of the data.

Bummer, right? I was only able to recover a few mockups.

Alas, such is the nature of the web.
