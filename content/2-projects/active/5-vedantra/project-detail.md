import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

I think this was the first client website that I designed in Sketch and built from the ground up in Kirby CMS. It may just be the most minimalist website I’ve ever designed, but it was designed for science people so it fits the audience. Probably.

Look out for the subtle (too subtle) motion effects in the hero on scroll, and in the gently wiggling illustration of the...what was that thing again? Some sciency acronym. It’s probably on the website somewhere.

Fun fact: during an interview with Datawheel, I was asked if I had any experience with data visualizations, and I was able to point to some bar charts that I made for this site. So thanks Vedantra for helping me get the gig! ✌️
