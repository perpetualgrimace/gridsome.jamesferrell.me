BK Productions Tampa is a studio and audio production company website of Daniel Gentry. Originally the brand was Black Key Recording, but the band The Black Keys threatened legal action so the studio went with a quick rebrand.

The site was originally a one pager, and was one of my first experiments in responsive design ([archived 2016 site](https://web.archive.org/web/20160105033457/http://blackkeyrecording.com/)).

In 2019, Daniel brought on business partner Tyler Coy, who expanded the scope of the business and website content, so they brought me back in for an overhaul. I rebuilt the site with Kirby CMS so that they could manage the content on their end.
