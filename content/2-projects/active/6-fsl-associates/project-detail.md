import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

This is a client website designed by Emily Toews and built on a shoestring budget with Kirby CMS. The site is still live at time of writing, but you’ll have to go visit [fslassociates.com](http://www.fslassociates.com) since I can’t embed it here.

It’s one of the few surviving websites built at Berman at time of writing, so it must be doing its job!

<CTA heading="Yo dawg, I heard you need a website" text="So let’s make you a website, and then I’ll put your website in my website so you can website while you website." />
