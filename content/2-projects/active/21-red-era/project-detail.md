This 2020 EP was a pandemic project with Chris Prinzel and Jack Pfiester, two incredibly talented guys that I met way back in the day in Tampa.

Chris did the bulk of the songwriting, with Jack handling vocals and me on drums.

The drums were recorded in my basement while the studio was still under construction. I reamped the guitars and handled the mix and master.

I'm happy with the mix, which favors the musicianship, but still I wish Jack let me make his vocals more prevalent.
