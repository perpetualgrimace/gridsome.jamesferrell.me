Probably the oldest recording project of mine that I’m still proud of, Ambushed was a group of talented dudes I was lucky enough to be a part of during the mid 2010s in Boston, MA. We demoed out two EPs, but the band imploded before we finished the latter.

In 2017, I revisited those recordings and the result was _Plinksticity Reloaded: Plinksticial Edition_. I tracked live drums, reamped guitars, and remixed all of released and unreleased material, then released it as one album.

Everything was recorded in practice spaces with thin walls, in between other bands making noise. I leaned into that vibe and tried not to overcook the mixes. The result is a relatively raw sonic character that compliments the songs.
