The CDC Patient Safety Portal offers data and safety recommendations for healthcare personnel.

The site was built with no regard to web accessiblity, but as you can probably expect, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/about/) had strict accessibilty standards that needed to be met.

I was brought in late in the project and made numerous changes to the codebase in order to bring it up to the [WCAG 2 standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1).

_The moral of the story: please don’t wait until just before launch to “add accessiblity” to a project, because if that’s the attitude then a large portion of the codebase may need to be rewritten._
