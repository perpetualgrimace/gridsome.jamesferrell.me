The Berman website was a fullfilling long term project. We went through more than one rebrand and rebuild (when you work at an advertising agency, rebranding is the answer to every problem), but each time I was able to learn a lot, and apply it to client work in turn. This is the website in its final state before Berman was acquired by [Overdrive Interactive](https://www.ovrdrv.com/).

The site was designed in Sketch and built with Kirby CMS. There was a big focus on inbound marketing, so I built out a robust blog. I also made flexible templates for case studies, since showing the work was priority number one.
