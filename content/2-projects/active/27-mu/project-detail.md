import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

This is collection of tools for managing assets. The servers page has some fun interactions that I’m proud of. I also worked on this company’s [marketing website](/projects/data-science-company-website).

_Note: currently under construction; aside from the color scheme, I established the branding._
