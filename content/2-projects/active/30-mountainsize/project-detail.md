import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

I’ve long dreamed of opening my own recording studio, and now I finally have!

For this website, I’m primarily targeting musicians under the greater heavy music umbrella, which is where I have the most experience.

I wrote a lot of copy about my approach, my process, and the services I offer. This is to convey to potential clients that even though I’m new to recording projects other than my own, I know what I’m doing and will do a good job.

<CTA heading="Held back by the quality of your recordings?" text="Come to think of it, I have a different website for solving this problem!" linkText="Visit mountainsizeaudio.com" link="https://mountainsizeaudio.com" />
