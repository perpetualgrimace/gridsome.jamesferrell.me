import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

This is a client website designed in Sketch and built in WordPress. The site is still live at time of writing, but you’ll have to go visit [butcherboymarket.com](https://butcherboymarket.com) since I can’t embed it here.

Okay although that’s all true, I really just wanted an excuse to put my all time favorite meme on my website. It’s my website, I’ll do what I want alright?!

<CTA heading="Yo dawg, I heard you need a website" text="So let’s make you a website, and then I’ll put your website in my website so you can website while you website." />
