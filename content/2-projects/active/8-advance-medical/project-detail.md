import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

Healthcare-focused client website designed in Sketch and built with Kirby CMS.

Advance Medical was a company that offered medical plans to employers. I was able to successfully talk the client out of using a video in the header, and we opted instead for a purely aesthetic slide show (which is the best type of slide show). Since the company had offices in multiple countries, the site needed to be multilingual as well.

<CTA heading="Need a custom website?" />
