import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

This is a marketing website designed and developed for a data science company. The aim was to concisely explain their services and how they can be (and have already been) integrated seamlessly into existing organizations. I also worked on this company’s [server management tool](/projects/server-management-frontend-test).

The enterprise trial page has a neat little quote calculator so potential clients can see how much the services would cost, and submit a request for a free trial. I’m proud of the transitions between states on this one!

_Note: currently under construction; aside from the color scheme, I established the branding._
