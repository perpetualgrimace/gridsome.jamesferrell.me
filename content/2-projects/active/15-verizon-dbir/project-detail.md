One of the coolest parts of working at Dataweel was getting the chance to work with big clients. Well, realistically they were often not as easygoing as smaller clients, but it was still cool!

Verizon hired us to make an interactive version of their annual [Data Breach Investigations Report](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/). I was brought into this role in a design capacity, sorting through the data and determining the best types of visualizations to represent each. I then handled some final touches, QA, and cross-browser testing.

While Verizon has since gone back to the document approach, taking down the prior interactive version of the DBIR, I was able to find a working (although slow) [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20211027125641/https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/interactive/) of the interactive report.
