import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

[Codelife](https://en.codelife.com) was the first project I took on at Datawheel, and it was a bit atypical for the company: a web application designed to teach kids to learn how to code!

It has courses with interactive lessons, as well as a standalone code editor which you can use to save projects.

Full stack developer Jimmy Mullen handled most of the business logic and tricky edge cases — my job was to make it beautiful and fun to use, even on mobile devices. Okay it’s tough to code on a phone, but we tried our best!

<CTA heading="Is your website easy to use on a phone?" />
