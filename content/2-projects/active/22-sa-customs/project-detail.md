import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

Web app designed to show data on Saudi Arabia’s imports and exports at a glance.

The team was especially interested in the clearance time metric — which is used to keep track of port effeciency — so I worked with another developer to build an interactive tool for exploring this called the clearance time calculator. There is also a data explorer, which allows you to create data visualizations on the fly.

The site was live for a few years, and then it wasn’t. Luckily it was built in Svelte, and was easy enough to restore, so it lives on in this early state!

<CTA heading="Need custom visualizations for your data?" />
