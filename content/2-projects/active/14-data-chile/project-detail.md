import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

DataChile was the first project handled by Datawheel’s remote branch. While they did an admirable job, I was brought on to smooth out some of the rough edges in the design implementation, often redesigning parts of the site.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the site relying heavily on APIs, only the home page works on the [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20220113092447/https://es.datachile.io/) of the site.

<CTA heading="Make sense of your data" />
