import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

This is an idea I had for a metronome app tailored for performing musicians.

There are plenty of existing metronome apps, but they are often either slow and bloated, or they don't provide an easy way to manage and rearrange tempos. I wanted an app that would solve both of these problems.

I mocked up a marketing site and a bunch of app screens, and even got as far as poking around with Xcode, and thought “this is a lot to learn, maybe I’ll come back to it when I have time.”

I never came back to it.

Realistically, lots of musicians who play to a metronome live are connected to fancy in-ear monitoring rigs controlled by a laptop. While this app would be a much easier gateway for drummers to dip their toe into that world, I’m not sure how much appeal or use it would actually have.
