import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

For a while, WriteSomething was the coolest thing I had worked on. At [Berman](/projects/berman), there was a yearly holiday tradition of taking on pro-bono work for a goodÂ cause. WriteSomething was an interactive story that benefited [826 Boston](https://826boston.org/), which is a nonprofit organization that focuses on writing and literacy needs of local Boston students. People were encouraged to write something, and thenÂ donate.

We commissioned a beautiful illustration for the story, titled The Abominable SnowKitten. We promited it hard on social media. On launch, someone immediately tried to end the story. We should have done more userÂ testing. ðŸ˜‚

The website is no longer live, but I made the logo, and designed and built the frontend â€” including a custom admin interface for managing entries. Scroll through the slides for some screenshots recovered from the [archived site](https://web.archive.org/web/20170614035922/http://writesomething.org/), as well as some recovered mockups for the adminÂ panel.

<CTA heading="Need a custom admin interface?" text="Letâ€™s design something that perfectly meets yourÂ needs!" />
