import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

Classy client website designed in Sketch and built with Kirby CMS.

Choice is a company that curates books for libraries. Blogging regularly was part of their business strategy, so I had the additional tasks of converting HTML articles to markdown and providing guidance for using the admin panel.

<CTA heading="Need a custom website?" />
