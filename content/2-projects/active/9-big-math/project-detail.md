Big Math was an ambitious remote project with my guitarist friend [Ben Beronda](https://www.instagram.com/benberonda/). I did much of the writing, and recorded drums at our friend’s [home studio](/projects/black-key-recording/) during a Tampa trip.

It’s not my best mix, but I learned a lot and this was where I began to get consistently decent results. I also handled the logo and album art.
