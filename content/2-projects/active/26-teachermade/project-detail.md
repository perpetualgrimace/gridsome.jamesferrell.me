import CTA from "~/components/CTA"

TeacherMade is a local Asheville startup. Their product provides teachers the ability to turn their existing tests and worksheets into interactive digital versions.

Given the difficult state of education during COVID times, the product was met with high demand. In their rush to meet the moment, design wasn't the first priority, which is why they brought me in for a complete design overhaul.
