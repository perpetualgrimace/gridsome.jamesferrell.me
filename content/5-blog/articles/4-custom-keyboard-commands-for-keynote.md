As a designer, youâ€™re going to have to create a Keynote presentation now and then. Thereâ€™s no getting around it. And if youâ€™re coming from an app like Photoshop or Sketch, youâ€™re bound to hit those familiar keyboard shortcuts out of habit. But when nothing (or the wrong thing) happens, a wave of emotion hits you: frustration, sadness, discomfort, uneasiness, helplessness, dizziness, drowsiness,Â etc.


Youâ€™re, uh â€”Â youâ€™re withÂ me, right...?


Yeah, so Iâ€™m a big fan of spending a bit of time up front to customize my tools in a way that makes them easier to use in the long run. The less I have to think about what Iâ€™m doing, the more efficient I can be, which means I have more time for important things like watching catÂ videos.


*Quick aside: If youâ€™re unsure how to set up custom keyboard shortcuts for specific MacOS applications, you will find instructions â€”Â andÂ aÂ gif â€” [at the end of thisÂ article](#how-to-set-up-shortcuts-in-macos).*

## Without further ado, the shortcuts:

<BulletList slug="keynote-commands-list" />

## How to set up shortcuts in MacOS

1. Open Keyboard preferences (in System Preferences)

2. In the toolbar, select *Shortcuts*

3. In the sidebar, select *App Shortcuts*

4. Hit the `+` icon to add a new shortcut

5. In the Application select box, choose *Keynote*

6. Enter the menu command that you want to shortcutify (mustÂ matchÂ exactly)

7. Input your keyboard shortcut

Boom isnâ€™t a command and <code>âŒ˜B</code> is already Bold, but you get the point.

## Now go forth, and be productive

And if you get frustrated, remember that it could always be worse. ItÂ couldÂ beÂ PowerPoint. ðŸ˜’
