import BulletList from "~/components/BulletList"

As a designer, you're going to have to create a Keynote presentation now and then. There's no getting around it. And if you're coming from an app like Photoshop or Sketch, you're bound to hit those familiar keyboard shortcuts out of habit. But when nothing (or the wrong thing) happens, a wave of emotion hits you: frustration, sadness, discomfort, uneasiness, helplessness, dizziness, drowsiness, etc.


You're, uh — you're with me, right...?


Yeah, so I'm a big fan of spending a bit of time up front to customize my tools in a way that makes them easier to use in the long run. The less I have to think about what I'm doing, the more efficient I can be, which means I have more time for important things like watching cat videos.


*Quick aside: If you're unsure how to set up custom keyboard shortcuts for specific applications in the Apple MacOS X ecosystem, you will find instructions — and a gif — [at the end of this article](#how-to-set-up-shortcuts-in-macos).*

## Without further ado, the shortcuts:

<BulletList slug="keynote-commands-list" />

## How to set up shortcuts in MacOS

1. Open Keyboard preferences (in System Preferences)

2. In the toolbar, select *Shortcuts*

3. In the sidebar, select *App Shortcuts*

4. Hit the `+` icon to add a new shortcut

5. In the Application select box, choose *Keynote*

6. Enter the menu command that you want to shortcutify (must match exactly)

7. Input your keyboard shortcut

Boom isn't a command and <code>⌘B</code> is already Bold, but you get the point.

## Now go forth, and be productive

And if you get frustrated, remember that it could always be worse. It could be PowerPoint. 😒
