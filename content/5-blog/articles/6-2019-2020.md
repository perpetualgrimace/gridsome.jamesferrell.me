## In 2019
- I married my partner of ten years **(!)**.
- I transitioned fully from design role to a front-end development role at Datawheel.
- I gave two quick talks at work: one about accessibility, and another about a design system I had been working on.
- I realized once and for all that I can’t work in an office. I’m too sensitive to noise, and there is _so much noise_ in an office.
- I quit my full-time job at Datawheel after working there for two years.
- I [rebuilt my website](/blog/gridsome) in Vue.
- I mixed and released an EP from my 2017 band, [Waypoints](https://waypoints.bandcamp.com/album/episode-2).
- I started a new band, which has since turned into yet another studio project.
- I moved into an apartment with a spare bedroom, which I’ve turned into an office/home studio space.
- I improved my ping pong skills considerably.
- I started cooking myself breakfast daily (two fried eggs and half an avocado — a great way to start the day).

## In 2020
- My wife and I will go on our honeymoon to Japan in February **(!)**.
- I will work exclusively on a contract basis, primarily remotely.
- I will design and build an iOS app.
- I will read more books. My current reading list:
  - [Inclusive Components](http://book.inclusive-components.design/)
  - [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/checkout/)
  - [Expressive Design Systems](https://abookapart.com/products/expressive-design-systems)
  - [Accessibility for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone)
- I will be more active on [my blog](/blog) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/perpetualgrimac).
- I will finish mixing and release an EP from a 2018-2019 band-turned-recording project.
- I will exercise daily, even if that only means taking a walk.
- I will learn to cook some healthy-ish dishes.
