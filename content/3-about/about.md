## About me

I’m a designer turned front-end developer — thus, UX developer or [Front-end designer](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/). Coming from a design background, the code I care most about is the code the user directly interacts with. So everything I write is responsive, accessible, performant, and well-designed.

I’m a generalist by way of specializing in one thing at a time over long periods of time; I consider myself more of a *builder* than a *creative*.

## Why hire me?

- Your website/app feels visually or architecturally disorganized, and you want to build a unified design system
- Your website/app loads slowly, isn’t optimized for mobile, or isn’t usable via keyboard or assistive technology; and you’d like to stop leaving money on the table by providing a poor experience in those contexts
- You want to build your website/app the right way from the beginning, so you don’t run into the above issues down the line

## Software & hardware

I have a page that lists [all the ware that I use](uses).

## Music & audio

Making music is time consuming and arguably less rewarding than making websites, but it’s an important part of my identity. Drums are my main instrument, and I also play enough guitar and bass to get my ideas across. For the past decade or so I’ve been engineering and mixing all of my projects as well.

I’m somewhat in between bands at the moment, with only a few ongoing recording projects at present. But in the past, I’ve been in an instrumental progressive math rock project called [Big Math](http://bigmath.bandcamp.com), an [award-winning](http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/content/your-2009-ultimate-local-band-triptico) Latin rock band called [Triptico](http://triptico.bandcamp.com), briefly joined national emocore band [Phoenix Mourning](http://www.metalblade.com/us/artists/phoenix-mourning/) for a tour across the states, played in the Boston rock bands [Waypoints](http://waypoints.bandcamp.com) and [Ambushed](http://ambushed.bandcamp.com), and made the first music that I wasn’t embarrassed of in [Broken Self](http://soundcloud.com/perpetualgrimace/sets/broken-self). From time to time, I also do [video game music tributes](http://soundcloud.com/perpetualgrimace/sets/video-game-covers).
