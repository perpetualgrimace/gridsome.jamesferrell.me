## About me

I'm [T-shaped](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/t-shaped-designers/), or [mortar](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/job-title-its-complicated/), or [multidisciplinary](https://www.toptal.com/designers/visual/multidisciplinary-design) — pick your favorite. I started out as a designer who codes, but my roles tend to evolve into more of a front-end developer who designs.

If you have a problem, I can solve it. Or if you just want to talk about music or retro video games, I'm happy to do that too. [Contact me](contact) (TODO: arrow link + epsilon)

## Software & hardware

I have a page that lists [all the ware that I use](uses).

## Music & audio

Making music is time consuming and arguably less rewarding than making websites, but it's an important part of my identity. Drums are my main instrument, and I also play enough guitar and bass to get my ideas across. For the past few years I've been engineering all of my projects as well.

I'm somewhat in between projects at the moment, but in the past I've played a big role in an instrumental progressive math rock project called [Big Math](http://bigmath.bandcamp.com), an [award-winning](http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/content/your-2009-ultimate-local-band-triptico) latin rock band called [Triptico](http://triptico.bandcamp.com), briefly joined national emocore band [Phoenix Mourning](http://www.metalblade.com/us/artists/phoenix-mourning/) for a tour across the states, played in the Boston rock bands [Waypoints](http://waypoints.bandcamp.com) and [Ambushed](http://ambushed.bandcamp.com), and made the first music that I wasn't embarrassed of in [Broken Self](http://soundcloud.com/perpetualgrimace/sets/broken-self). From time to time, I also do [video game music tributes](http://soundcloud.com/perpetualgrimace/sets/video-game-covers).
