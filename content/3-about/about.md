## About me

I’m a designer turned front-end developer — thus, [UX developer](http://www.disambiguity.com/what-is-a-ux-developer/) or [front-end designer](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/). Coming from a design background, the code I care most about is the code the user directly interacts with. So everything I write is well-designed, responsive, accessible, and fast.

I’m a generalist by way of specializing in one thing at a time over long periods of time; I consider myself more of a _builder_ than a *creative*.

## Reasons you should hire me

- Your website/app loads slowly, isn’t optimized for mobile, or isn’t usable via keyboard or assistive technology; and you’d like to stop leaving money on the table by providing a poor experience in those contexts
- Your website/app feels visually or architecturally disorganized, and you want to build a unified design system
- You want to build your website/app the right way from the beginning, so you don’t run into the above issues down the line
- Your entire team consists of full-stack developers
- You just want to have nice things

## Software & hardware

I have a page that lists [all the ware that I use](uses).

## Music & audio

When I'm not working on websites, you’ll likely find me working on music.

I often do weekend tours as the frontman and primary songwriter for my rock and/or metal band [The Welcoming](https://thewelcomingmusic.com).

I also run a small recording studio, teach drums, and fix up audio gear, which is all under the banner of [Mountainsize Audio](https://mountainsizeaudio.com).
