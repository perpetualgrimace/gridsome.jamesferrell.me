This site was designed in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and built from the ground up with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) via [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/). The code is on [Github](https://github.com/perpetualgrimace/gridsome.jamesferrell.me) and gets pushed live automagically thanks to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I wrote a [blog post](https://jamesferrell.me/blog/gridsome) about rebuilding the site with this stack.
