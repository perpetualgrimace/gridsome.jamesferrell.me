      These are also taken straight from Photoshop. "If it ain't broke," as they say.

    title: Alignment
    description: >
      These will feel right at home to anyone who has played games on a keyboard. But make sure to use Ctrl instead of Cmd, or else you'll accidentally close the window, select all, or save the file. The moral of the story is that system shortcuts can't be overwritten.
    items:

        Top: <code>⌃W</code>

        Left: <code>⌃A</code>

      These just feel right:
    items:

        Group: <code>⌘G</code>
      - |
        Ungroup: <code>⇧⌘G</code>

    title: Animation
    description: >
      Since Apple still hasn't re-implemented support for master slide transitions and object animations in Keynote 😭, the ability to quickly copy and paste animations from one object to another is a lifesaver.
    items:
      - |
        Copy Animation: <code>⇧⌘C</code>
      - |
        Paste Animation: <code>⇧⌘V</code>

    title: Navigation
    description: >
      I'm accustomed to using `⌥⌘←` and `⌥⌘→` to move between tabs in web browsers and text editors. But in Keynote's navigator the slides are laid out vertically, so using ↑ and ↓ to move between them just feels better to me.
    items:
      - |
        Previous Slide: <code>⌥⌘↑</code>
      - |
        Next Slide: <code>⌥⌘↓</code>

    title: Showing and hiding panels
    description: >
      If you're working on a big presentation on a little screen, these will come in very handy:
    items:
      - |
        Show Build Order: <code>⇧⌘B</code>
      - |
        Hide Build Order: <code>⇧⌘B</code>
      - |
        Show Object List: <code>⌘\</code>
      - |
        Hide Object List: <code>⌘\</code>

    title: Showing and hiding guides
    description: >
      Oh, guides in Keynote. "What if we made guides impossible to place precisely, when their sole reason for existence is to make the placement of objects more precise?" Um, I think I got off track. These shortcuts are useful for showing and hiding Keynote's crappy guides:
    items:
      - |
        Show Guides: <code>⌘;</code>
      - |
        Hide Guides: <code>⌘;</code>
