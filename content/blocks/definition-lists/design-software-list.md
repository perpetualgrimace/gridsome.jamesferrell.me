## Design software

### [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) & [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
I use and enjoy both of these modern design apps.

### Photoshop
Great for editing photos, and clunky as hell for everything else.

### [PixelSnap](https://getpixelsnap.com)
Quickly measure the spacing between things, which is like 90% what design is.

### [svgsus](http://www.svgs.us)
Keeps vector icon libraries at the ready, incredibly useful. I wish I had come up with that name — just so clever.

### [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/)
When I have to put a presentation together, Keynote makes me hate my life the least. Good for quick animations too. I have some [custom key command recommendations](blog/custom-keyboard-commands-for-keynote) for it.
