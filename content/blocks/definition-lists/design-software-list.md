## Design software

### [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com)
My design software of choice. It makes web and UI design both efficient and realistic. Still waiting on nested character stylesÂ though. ðŸ˜’

### Photoshop
Great for editing photos, and clunky as hell for everythingÂ else.

### [PixelSnap](https://getpixelsnap.com)
Quickly measure the spacing between things, which is like 90% what designÂ is.

### [svgsus](http://www.svgs.us)
Keeps vector icon libraries at the ready, incredibly useful. I wish I had come up with that name â€”Â just soÂ clever.

### [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/)
When I have to put a presentation together, Keynote makes me hate my life theÂ least. Good for quick animations too. IÂ have some [custom key command recommendations](blog/custom-keyboard-commands-for-keynote) forÂ it.
