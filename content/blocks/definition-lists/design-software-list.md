## Design software

### [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com)
My design software of choice. It makes web and UI design both efficient and realistic. Still waiting on nested character styles though. 😒

### Photoshop
Great for editing photos, and clunky as hell for everything else.

### [Icon Slate](https://www.kodlian.com/apps/icon-slate)
The most friendly way I've found to make custom app icons and favicons.

### [svgsus](http://www.svgs.us)
Keeps vector icon libraries at the ready, incredibly useful. It also has a very clever name.

### [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/)
Comes in handy for quick and dirty animations. Also, if I have to put a presentation together, Keynote makes me hate my life the least. I have some [custom keyboard recommendations](blog/custom-keyboard-commands-for-keynote) for it.
