## Design software

### [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com)
My design software of choice. It makes web and UI design both efficient and realistic. Now if only they would implement nested character styles it would be perfect. ðŸ˜’

### Photoshop
Great for editing photos, and clunky as hell for everything else.

### [Icon Slate](https://www.kodlian.com/apps/icon-slate)
The most friendly way I've found to make custom app icons and favicons.

### [svgsus](http://www.svgs.us)
Keeps vector icon libraries at the ready, incredibly useful. It also has a very cleverÂ name.

### [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/)
Comes in handy for quick and dirty animations. Also, if I have to put a presentation together, Keynote makes me hate my life the least.
