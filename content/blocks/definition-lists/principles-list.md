## Core principles

### Discipline
I always adhere to the process of my craft. It can be tempting to skip ahead, but cut corners are always visible in the end.

### Efficiency
I learn my tools inside and out so that I can focus on the task at hand.

### Problem Solving
I excel at clearly defining and solving problems, which is 90% of design.

### Minimalism
I'm a proponent of ruthlessly trimming the fat. If it isn't useful, helpful, or fun, then get rid of it.

### Usability
I build websites that the user can easily use and understand.

### Empathy
I'm always trying to understand other perspectives. Especially those that differ from my own.

### Transparency
I'm a big proponent of open communication. Surprises lead to frustration.

### Humor
Expect a bit of silliness here and there. I take my work seriously, but that doesn't mean I can't have a good time while doing it.
