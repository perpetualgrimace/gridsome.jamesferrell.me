## Development software

### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
It’s like Atom, but loads up quickly and doesn’t make my computer chug. I use the One Dark theme so it feels even more like Atom. Markdown editing is nice, too.

### [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/)
Makes Git a bit more approachable and I use it regularly.

### Terminal
When I need to run `npm run dev`, Terminal gets the job done.

### [Transit](https://panic.com/transmit/)
The best FTP client around, if I have to use an FTP client.

### Image optimization tools
**[Squash](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/squash/)**, **[JPEGmini](https://www.jpegmini.com)**, **[svgo-gui](https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui)**, and **[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)** are all useful for quickly batch optimizing images. Which I do for every web project, because [performance is important](blog/five-signs-that-your-website-needs-attention#2-its-slow).
