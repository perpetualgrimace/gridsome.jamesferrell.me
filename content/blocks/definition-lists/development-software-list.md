## Development software

### [Atom](https://atom.io)
Currently my code editor of choice. It's hard to argue with the cost of admission, and there is no shortage of themes and ~~plugins~~ packages. I also use it for note taking and list making.

### [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/)
Makes Git a bit more approachable and I use it regularly.

### Terminal
What I use when I feel like using the command line. Which admittedly isn't often. So Terminal is good enough for me.

### [Transit](https://panic.com/transmit/)
The best FTP client around, if I have to use an FTP client.

### Image optimization tools
**[Squash](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/squash/)**, **[JPEGmini](https://www.jpegmini.com)**, **[svgo-gui](https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui)**, and **[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)** are all useful for quickly batch optimizing images. Which I do for every web project, because [performance is important](blog/five-signs-that-your-website-needs-attention#2-its-slow).
