## Development software

### [Atom](https://www.atom.io/)
I’ve tried the others; I’m most comfortable and efficient with this one.

### [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/)
Makes Git a bit more approachable and I use it pretty regularly.

### Terminal
When I need to run `npm run dev`, Terminal gets the job done. Just kidding, I also know how to run `cd` and `ls`.

### Image optimization tools
**[Squash](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/squash/)**, **[JPEGmini](https://www.jpegmini.com)**,  and **[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)** are all useful for quickly batch optimizing images. Which I do for every web project, because [performance is important](blog/five-signs-that-your-website-needs-attention#2-its-slow).
