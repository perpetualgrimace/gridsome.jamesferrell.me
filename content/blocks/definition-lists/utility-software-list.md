Slack-style emoji picker. ❤️

The most friendly way I’ve found to capture video from part of my screen.

### [Memory Clean](https://fiplab.com/apps/memorycleanformac)

### [BetterSnapTool](https://www.boastr.net/bettersnaptool/)
Brings over the quick window resizing behavior from Windows 7, which was the only Windows feature that I missed after switching to Mac.

### [Copy Clip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclipformac)
A buffer for clipboard history. 😌

### [HocusFocus](http://hocusfoc.us)
Automatically hides app windows that I’m not using, which prevents window clutter without me having to think about it.

### [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com)
Gives me control over which menu bar icons clutter up my menu bar. *Begone, Siri!*
