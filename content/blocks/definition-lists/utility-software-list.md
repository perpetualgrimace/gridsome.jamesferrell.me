## Handy utilities

### [Cardhop](https://flexibits.com/cardhop)
Contacts app made by the same folks who made Fantastical. Similarly to Fantastical, they nailed it.

### [Giphy Capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture)
The most friendly way I've found to capture video from part of my screen.

### [Memory Clean](https://fiplab.com/apps/memorycleanformac)
Optimizes my available RAM without me having to think about it.

### [BetterSnapTool](https://www.boastr.net/bettersnaptool/)
Brings over the quick window resizing behavior from Windows 7, which is literally the only Windows feature that I missed after switching to Mac.

### [Copy Clip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclipformac)
Gives me access to my clipboard history. Which is great, because I do a lot of copying and pasting.

### [HocusFocus](http://hocusfoc.us)
Automatically hides app windows that I'm not using, which prevents window clutter without me having to think about it.

### [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com)
Gives me control over which menu bar icons clutter up my menu bar. *Begone, Siri!*
