## Handy utilities

### [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)
Slack-style emoji picker. ❤️

### [Cardhop](https://flexibits.com/cardhop)
Contacts app made by the same folks who made Fantastical. Like with Fantastical, they nailed it.

### [Giphy Capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture)
The most friendly way I’ve found to capture video from part of my screen.

### [Copy Clip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclipformac)
A buffer for clipboard history. 😌

### [BetterSnapTool](https://www.boastr.net/bettersnaptool/)
Quick window resizing behavior from Windows 7, which was the only Windows feature that I missed after switching to Mac.

### [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com)
Gives me control over which menu bar icons clutter up my menu bar. *Begone, Siri!*
