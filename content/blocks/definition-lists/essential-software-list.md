## Essentials

### A handful of browsers
Firefox for everyday browsing, Chrome for media viewing. Cross browser testing is less horrible these days but stillÂ important.

### [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
The perfect calendar app. I can quickly add calendar events with human language. Iâ€™m terrible with dates, so a good calendar app isÂ crucial.

### [Notion](https://notion.so)
One app for all my note taking, TODO list, and project planningÂ needs.

### [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/)
Spark is good enough for managing my email for now. Iâ€™ll always miss [Mailbox](https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9873268/why-dropbox-mailbox-shutdown)Â though. ðŸ˜­

### [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
Home for every file that doesnâ€™t live in a git repository. It suffers from enterprise feature bloat, but still the best when it comes to simple syncing and sharing.

### [TweetBot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)
The best Twitter client Iâ€™ve been able to find. It displays tweets in reverse chronological order and lets you filter out keywords and hashtags â€”Â basically, it makes TwitterÂ usable.
