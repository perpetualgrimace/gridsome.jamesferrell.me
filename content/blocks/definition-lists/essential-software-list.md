## Essentials

### [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)
Currently trying this out as my main browser. It’s very customizable and — more importantly — fast and efficient.

### [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/)
Spark is good enough for managing my email for now. I’ll always miss [Mailbox](https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9873268/why-dropbox-mailbox-shutdown) though. 😭

### [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
The perfect calendar app. I can quickly add calendar events with human language. I’m terrible with dates, so a good calendar app is crucial.

### [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
Home for every file that doesn’t live in a git repository. I can selectively sync files so that I don’t have to fill up my hard drive with files I don’t need, the version control can be a lifesaver, and sharing files is dead simple. Please don’t make me use Google Drive. 🙅‍♀️

### [TweetBot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)
The best Twitter client I’ve been able to find. It displays tweets in reverse chronological order and lets you filter out keywords and hashtags — basically, it makes Twitter usable. It also supports multiple user accounts.
