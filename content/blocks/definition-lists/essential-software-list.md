## Essentials

### [Opera](https://www.opera.com)
Currently my web browser of choice. It's mostly as good as Chrome and has a built in VPN.

### [Missive](https://missiveapp.com/)
I'll always miss Mailbox (R.I.P.). Missive is a good enough replacement for now.

### [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
The perfect calendar app. I can quickly add calendar events with human language. I'm terrible with dates, so a good calendar app is crucial.

### [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
Home for every file that doesn't live in a git repo. I can selectively sync files so that I don't have to fill up my hard drive with files I don't need, the version control can be a lifesaver, and sharing files is dead simple.

### [TweetBot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)
The best twitter client I've been able to find. It displays tweets in reverse chronological order, filters out keywords and hashtags, and supports multiple userÂ accounts.
