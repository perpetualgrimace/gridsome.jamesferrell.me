### Arrangement

These are taken straight from Photoshop:

- Send Backward: `⌘[`
- Send to Back: `⇧⌘[`
- Bring Forward: `⌘]`
- Bring to Front: `⇧⌘]`


### Zooming

These are also taken straight from Photoshop. "If it ain't broke," as they say.

- Zoom in: `⌘=`
- Zoom out: `⌘-`
- Zoom to Fit: `⌘0`
- Actual Size: `⌘1`


### Alignment

These will feel right at home to anyone who has played games on a keyboard. But make sure to use Ctrl instead of Cmd, or else you'll accidentally close the window, select all, or save the file. The moral of the story is that system shortcuts can't be overwritten.

- Top: `⌃W`
- Left: `⌃A`
- Bottom: `⌃S`
- Right: `⌃D`


### Grouping and locking

These just feel right:

- Group: `⌘G`
- Ungroup: `⇧⌘G`
- Lock: `⌘L`
- Unlock: `⇧⌘L`


### Animation

Since Apple hasn't re-implemented support for master slide transitions and object animations in Keynote at time of writing ( 😭), the ability to quickly copy and paste animations from one object to another is a lifesaver.

- Copy Animation: `⇧⌘C`
- Paste Animation: `⇧⌘V`


### Navigation

I'm accustomed to using `⌥⌘←` and `⌥⌘→` to move between tabs in web browsers and text editors. But in Keynote's navigator the slides are laid out vertically, so using ↑ and ↓ to move between them just feels better to me.

- Previous Slide: `⌥⌘↑`
- Next Slide: `⌥⌘↓`


### Showing and hiding panels

If you're working on a big presentation on a little screen, these will come in very handy:

- Show Build Order: `⇧⌘B`
- Hide Build Order: `⇧⌘B`
- Show Object List: `⌘\`
- Hide Object List: `⌘\`


### Showing and hiding guides

Oh, guides in Keynote. "What if we made guides impossible to place precisely, when their sole reason for existence is to make the placement of objects more precise?" Um, I think I got off track. These shortcuts are useful for showing and hiding Keynote's crappy guides:

- Show Guides: `⌘;`
- Hide Guides: `⌘;`
